### Christmas in Cuba be like LOL.
#### Christmas in a Cuban restaurant.
On Christmas I was in Cuba. The restaurant we normally ate in had a few changes on Christmas and Christmas Eve.

1. There were a large amount of balloons taped together in the entry foyer. 
2. On Christmas Eve adults could get a free glass of champagne.
3. There where pinapples loaded with food on top of them.
4. The outdoor steakhouse was open.
5. There where apples.

Brief history fact about Cuba and apples;
Traditionally Cubans eat apples on one day of the year Christmas Eve.
But at restaurant which is a buffet. Apples where also were served on Christmas.

I don't know if this is a new change to the tradition or are they just breaking the rules to get rid of apples. LOL!
